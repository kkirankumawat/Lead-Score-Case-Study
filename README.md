# Lead-Score-Case-Study
Creating ML model for predicting Lead Score

**Problem Description **
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, 
many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.
The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land 
on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When 
these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. 
Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from 
the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted 
while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%

**Business Goals**
- to identify the most potential leads ie hot leads
- to build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and vice versa
- Target lead conversion rate to be increased (around 80 %)
